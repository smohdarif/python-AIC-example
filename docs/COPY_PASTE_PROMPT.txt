Please modify this organizational chart to show three career path options for Arif Shaikh. Keep ALL existing content unchanged. Add these three options as new visual elements:

Box Text:
  "OPTION 1: AMS CORPORATE LEAD
   Arif Shaikh
   AMS Corporate Lead

   • Takes over permanent AMS Corporate leadership
   • Enables Mike Duval to focus 100% on Global Operations Lead"

Visual: Blue border (#4A90E2), same styling as existing boxes
Shows: Arif taking over from Mike's interim dual-role, allowing Mike to focus solely on Global Operations


OPTION 2 - SEGMENT ARCHITECT AMS CORPORATE (GREEN BORDER):
Position: Create new box at same level as "Mark Szczewski AMS Enterprise", positioned between or adjacent to existing AMS sections
Box Text:
  "OPTION 2: SEGMENT ARCHITECT

Visual: Green border (#66BB6A, different shade from Mike's box), same size as existing boxes
Shows: Peer-level architect position parallel to other regional leaders


OPTION 3 - AI PRACTICE LEAD PS AMS ⭐ PRIMARY (PURPLE BORDER):

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ Each option MUST be clearly labeled: "OPTION 1", "OPTION 2", "OPTION 3"

✅ Match existing font family (Arial/Helvetica), rounded corners
✅ All existing boxes, names, and connections remain UNCHANGED

- Option 2: "Technical architecture expertise"
- Option 3: "Strategic AI leadership opportunity"
